		Until end of turn, the next two permanent spells you cast gain veil and may be cast as though they had accelerate. For each, its veil and accelerate costs are equal to “Pay X life.”, where X is its mana value. <i-auto>(You may cast it for its accelerate cost any time you could cast an instant. If you do, it can’t block this turn and is sacrificed at the beginning of your next upkeep.)</i-auto>
		If accelerated this way, they gain <kw-0><nospellcheck><key>haste</key></nospellcheck></kw-0> and <kw-0><nospellcheck><key>berserk</key></nospellcheck></kw-0>. <i-auto>(<kw-0><nospellcheck><key>Berserk</key></nospellcheck></kw-0> creatures must attack each combat if able.)</i-auto>
