		When this Aura enters, return target artifact, enchantment, or battle card from your graveyard to the battlefield, then attach this Aura to it. If this Aura was accelerated and enchanted permanent isn’t a battle, it gains <kw-a><nospellcheck><key>haste</key></nospellcheck></kw-a> and becomes a 4/4 creature in addition to its other types until end of turn.
		When this Aura leaves the battlefield, enchanted permanent’s controller sacrifices it at the beginning of the next phase <i-auto>(begin, main, combat, or end)</i-auto>.
		<kw-1><nospellcheck><key>Accelerate <param-cost><sym-auto>R</sym-auto></param-cost></key></nospellcheck><atom-reminder-> <i-auto>(You may cast this spell for its accelerate cost any time you could cast an instant. If you do, it’s sacrificed at the beginning of your next upkeep.)</i-auto></atom-reminder-></kw-1>
