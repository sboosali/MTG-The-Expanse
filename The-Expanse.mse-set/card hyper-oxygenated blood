		Target creature card in your graveyard gains resuscitate and veil until end of turn. The resuscitate and veil costs are “Pay X life.”, where X is its mana value. <i-auto>(You may cast that card from your graveyard for its resuscitate cost; it enters with a <kw-a><nospellcheck><key>finality counter</key></nospellcheck></kw-a>. Whenever that spell becomes the target of an opposing spell/ability, counter that spell/ability unless that opponent pays its veil cost.)</i-auto>
		If resuscitated this way, it doesn’t enter with a <kw-a><nospellcheck><key>finality counter</key></nospellcheck></kw-a> on it.
