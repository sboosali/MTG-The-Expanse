		When this creature enters, counter target spell you don’t own, expropriating it instead. <i-auto>(If countered, exile it face down. You may look at and cast expropriated <error-spelling:en_US:/magic.mse-game/dictionary/magic-words>nonlands</error-spelling:en_US:/magic.mse-game/dictionary/magic-words> from exile, and may spend mana as though it were of any type to do so. Timing rules still apply.)</i-auto>
		When this creature leaves the battlefield, the exiled card’s owner may cast it without paying its mana cost.
		<kw-1><nospellcheck><key>Accelerate <param-cost><sym-auto>U</sym-auto></param-cost></key></nospellcheck><atom-reminder-> <i-auto>(You may cast this spell for its accelerate cost any time you could cast an instant. If you do, it can’t block this turn and is sacrificed at the beginning of your next upkeep.)</i-auto></atom-reminder-></kw-1>
