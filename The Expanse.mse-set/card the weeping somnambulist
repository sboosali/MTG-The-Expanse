		<sym>T</sym>: The next targeted instant or sorcery spell you cast this turn may be cast as though it had overload. Its overload cost is equal to its mana cost plus <sym>1</sym>. <i-auto>(If you overload a spell, change its text by replacing all instances of “target” with “each”, if able. For example, “Destroy target creature.” becomes “Destroy each creature.” For damage, “[damage to] any target” is replaced with “each creature, player, and battle”.)</i-auto>
		Whenever you cast an <error-spelling:en_US:/magic.mse-game/dictionary/magic-words>untargeted</error-spelling:en_US:/magic.mse-game/dictionary/magic-words> instant or sorcery spell, you may have this Vehicle become an artifact creature until end of turn.
