	rule_text: Target opponent reveals their hand. You choose a nonland card from it with mana value at most 3 or with an alternate cost <i-auto>(such as accelerate or resuscitate)</i-auto>. That player discards that card.
	flavor_text: <i-flavor>Lopez reached into his pocket, took out a small packet of white lozenges, and popped one into his mouth. Focus drugs. He’d be watching every tic of Holden’s face during questioning. Tough to lie to.</i-flavor>
