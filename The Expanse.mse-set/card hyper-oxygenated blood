		Choose target creature card in your graveyard.
		It gains resuscitate and veil until end of turn. The resuscitate and veil costs are “Pay X life.”, where X is its mana value. <i-auto>(You may cast that card from your graveyard for its resuscitate cost. It enters with a <kw-a><nospellcheck><key>finality counter</key></nospellcheck></kw-a>. Whenever that spell becomes the target of an <kw-a><nospellcheck><key>opposing</key></nospellcheck></kw-a> spell or ability, counter that effect unless that opponent pays its veil cost.)</i-auto>
	flavor_text: <i-flavor>Skin bruising, corneas deforming, lungs flattening, blood boiling: she stabs the syringe into her thigh, and lives.</i-flavor>
