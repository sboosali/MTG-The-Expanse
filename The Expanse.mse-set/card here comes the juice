	rule_text:
		Until end of turn, the next creature spell you cast gains veil and may be cast as though it had accelerate. Its veil and accelerate costs are each equal to “Pay X life.”, where X is its mana value. <i-auto>(You may cast it for its accelerate cost any time you could cast an instant. If you do, it can’t block this turn and is sacrificed at the beginning of your next upkeep.)</i-auto>
		If accelerated this way, it gains <kw-0><nospellcheck><key>haste</key></nospellcheck></kw-0> and <kw-0><nospellcheck><key>berserk</key></nospellcheck></kw-0>. <i-auto>(<kw-0><nospellcheck><key>Berserk</key></nospellcheck></kw-0> creatures must attack each combat if able.)</i-auto>
